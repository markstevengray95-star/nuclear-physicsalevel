The neutron number N is the number of neutrons. The nucleon number A is the total number of nucleons, so A = Z + N and N = A − Z. Changing Z changes the element; changing N while keeping Z fixed produces a different isotope of the same element."],
  ["Nuclide notation","A nuclide symbol records the chemical symbol together with A and Z. The lower number is Z and the upper number is A. Once A and Z are known, N follows immediately. Nuclear equations should conserve total nucleon number and total charge, so nuclide notation also becomes a checking tool later in the topic."],

Alpha is stopped very readily, beta penetrates further but is strongly reduced by thin metal, and gamma is attenuated progressively. Gamma does not have one universal stopping thickness."],

 summary:"This lesson brings nuclear physics into safety and decision-making. Students should know the specified safety features, how radioactive waste is managed conceptually, and how to evaluate benefits and risks using physics evidence.",
 sections:[
  ["Fuel","A thermal fission reactor uses fissile nuclear fuel; uranium fuel containing uranium-235 is a standard A-level example. Fission products and some fuel-related materials are radioactive, so containment and radiation protection are important."],
  ["Remote handling and shielding","Remote handling increases distance between workers and radioactive material and avoids direct contact. Shielding attenuates radiation before it reaches people or the environment. These controls reduce exposure but do not change the decay constant or half-life of the radioactive material."],
  ["Emergency shutdown","A shutdown system must rapidly reduce sustained neutron multiplication, for example by increasing neutron absorption. The examinable idea is the physics purpose of stopping/reducing the chain reaction, not detailed engineering design."],
  ["Radioactive waste","Waste is produced during reactor operation and fuel use. It can contain radionuclides with different radiation types, activities and half-lives. Handling and storage must keep radioactive material contained while its activity changes with time."],
  ["Half-life and waste","A long half-life means slow fractional decay, but it does not by itself tell you the activity; activity also depends on λ and the number of nuclei. Waste questions may ask about how storage timescale and activity are related."],
  ["Risk-benefit evaluation","Benefits can include large energy release from small amounts of fuel, reliable generation and low operational carbon emissions. Challenges include radioactive waste, engineering cost and low-probability/high-consequence accident scenarios. A strong answer uses physics evidence, separates probability from consequence and reaches a justified conclusion."]

 summary:"The final lesson should make students able to select and combine nuclear models under unfamiliar conditions. It revises the whole topic through model choice, multi-stage calculations, evidence interpretation and high-quality extended writing.",
 sections:[
  ["Choose the model first","Closest approach uses Coulomb energy. Electron diffraction uses matter waves. Radioactive decay uses probability and exponential mathematics. Binding/reaction energy uses mass-energy. Reactor behaviour uses neutron balance and collision ideas. Identify which physical model answers the question before choosing equations."],
  ["Plan multi-stage calculations","Write the chain before substituting values. Typical chains include mass → moles → nuclei → activity; half-life → decay constant → exponential decay; mass difference → energy → binding energy per nucleon. This exposes unit conversions and prevents equation-hopping."],
  ["Analyse evidence","Describe what the graph/data show before explaining why. Quantify gradients, ratios or proportionality where possible. Then connect the evidence to the relevant physical model and state any important limitations or assumptions."],
  ["Write explanations","Use a cause → physics principle/equation → effect chain. Precise terms such as 'background-corrected count rate', 'binding energy per nucleon' or 'constant probability per unit time' usually earn more credit than vague descriptions."],
  ["Evaluate","An evaluation should use evidence on more than one side, identify relevant limitations or risks, and finish with a conclusion that follows from the evidence. Do not use a memorised conclusion that ignores the question context."],
  ["Connect the topic","Scattering and diffraction give evidence about nuclear structure and size; radioactive decay connects microscopic randomness to macroscopic statistics; nuclear energy levels explain gamma emission; mass-energy explains binding, fusion and fission; neutron physics links nuclear events to power generation and safety."]
